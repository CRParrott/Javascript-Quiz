# Javascript-Quiz

The following is a Javascript quiz that tracks a users responses and renders a score.


I was able to render the questions and track the correct answers. The timer is a difficult feature that I could not figure out how to track and subtract time for wrong answers. I tried several ways to add it in and couldn't get them to work with the quiz questions.
